Hi, this program is a Dungons and Dragons abnormal-party-size monster calculator built so you don't wipe your whole party (even if its just 2 of you). Unlike most found online, this program will continue to give accurate monster stats, even if playing with less than or more than the traditional four players. 

This calculator will give you:

XP
Proficancy Bonus
AC
HP
Attack Bonus
Damage
DC
Saves

It takes into account:

player/monster advantages
monster status (minion/leader)
difficulty (easy-deadly)
